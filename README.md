# DevOps

DevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry used as a set of practices and tools. DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve and shorten the systems development life cycle.

Proposals to combine software development methodologies with deployment and operations concepts began to appear in the late 80s and early 90s.

The motivations for what has become modern DevOps and several standard DevOps practices such as automated build and test, continuous integration, and continuous delivery originated in the Agile world, which dates (informally) to the 1990s, and formally to 2001. Today, DevOps focuses on the deployment of developed software.

At its core and perhaps the most remarkable concept that the DevOps approach ever brought is the collaboration between the software development and operations teams. DevOps approach emphasis is on the automation of software development processes like build, test, incident detection and response, release, and others to yield a faster time-to-market, high-quality products, and reduced failures and rollbacks of software/software features.
