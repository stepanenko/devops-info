# DevOps

DevOps is not a tool, technology, or framework. It is more a philosophy, concept and a methodology. It is a set of practices and tools that combines and automates software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve and shorten the development life cycle.

Proposals to combine software development with deployment and operations began to appear in the late 80s and early 90s. The motivations for what has become modern DevOps and several standard DevOps practices such as automated build and test, continuous integration, and continuous delivery originated in the Agile world, which dates (informally) to the 1990s, and formally to 2001. Today, DevOps focuses on the deployment of developed software.

At its core DevOps is the collaboration between the software development and operations teams. DevOps emphasis is on the automation of software development processes like build, test, incident detection and response, release, and others to yield a faster time-to-market, high-quality products, and reduced failures and rollbacks of software/features. 

Main Objectives of DevOps:

- Establish a framework for particular applications and guarantee scalability.
- Create collaboration between software development and IT operations teams.
- Automate processes like testing, deployment, and monitoring to reduce errors.
- Execute integration and delivery practices to quickly releases software.
- Encourage continuous feedback and refinement by collecting metrics and analyzing data.
- Helping teams to be flexible and react promptly to changing customer demands.
- Integrate testing, monitoring, feedback loops and security into development process.
